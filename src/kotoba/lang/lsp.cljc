  "An LSP-style document model as pure data for the kotoba foundational stdlib.
  Layer 4 (tooling).

  Positions are 0-based {:line :character} (matching the LSP wire format). A
  range is {:start :end}. A diagnostic is {:range :severity :source :message}.
  No JSON-RPC transport is baked in — a kotoba cell gets the wire from the host;
  this lib owns the data contract. Pure functions, no host.

  Zero third-party runtime deps; .cljc (JVM / SCI / CLJS / GraalVM / kotoba-WASM)."
